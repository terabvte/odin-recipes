		<h3>Description üë®‚Äçüç≥</h3>
		<p>
			Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base
			of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, <br />
			cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high
			temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients üåæ</h3>
		<em><u>For making 3 pizzas of 28cm diameter each...</u></em>
		<ul>
			<li>200g <strong>manitoba</strong> flour</li>
			<li>300g <strong>00 flour (all-purpose flour)</strong></li>
			<li>300ml <strong>room temperature </strong>water</li>
			<li>4g <strong>fresh brewer's yeast</strong></li>
			<li>10g <strong>fine salt</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<em><u>For seasoning</u></em>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>300g <strong>tomato puree</strong></li>
			<li>200g <strong>mozzarella</strong></li>
			<li><strong>basil</strong><em> to taste</em></li>
			<li><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong><em> to taste</em></li>
		</ul>
		<u><em>For spreading the pizzas</em></u>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>re-milled durum wheat semolina</strong><em> to taste</em></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps üçΩÔ∏è</h3>
		<em><u>Making the pizza dough</u></em>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Proof the yeast:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.
						Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes
						until the yeast is dissolved.
					</li>
					<li>
						After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The
						yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is
						still active and alive.
					</li>
					<li>
						(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active
						yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next
						step.)
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Make and knead the pizza dough:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing
						paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the
						mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook
						about 7-10 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and
						knead them by hand.
					</li>
					<li>
						The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's
						too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Let the dough rise:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl.
						Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets
						coated with the oil.
					</li>
					<li>
						At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment
						and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result
						in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2
						hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to
						work with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap
					</li>
					<li>
						For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75¬∞F to 85¬∞F) for
						1 1/2 hours. <br />
						For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature
						place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer
						rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than
						48 hours).
					</li>
					<li>
						The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust
						will have.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<em><u>Preparing the pizzas</u></em>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>
					Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet):</strong
				>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven.
						Preheat the oven to 475¬∞F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an
						hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a
						thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high
						temperatures.
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Divide the dough into 2 balls:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour
						and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in
						half.
					</li>
					<li>
						Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with
						plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Prep the toppings:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want
						to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end
						up not crisp that way.
					</li>
					<li>
						About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be
						sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will
						cover a pizza.
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and
						flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface. <br />
						Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to
						press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until
						it will not stretch further.
					</li>
					<li>
						Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until
						it reaches the desired diameter‚Äî10 to 12 inches. <br />
						You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers,
						letting the dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges
						of the dough.
					</li>
					<li>
						If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured
						surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker.
						Pinch the edges if you want to form a lip.
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Brush the dough top with olive oil:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface
						of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush the top of the dough with
						olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let
						rest another 10 to 15 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>Repeat with the second ball of dough.</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong
					>Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on
					top:</strong
				>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with
						cornmeal. (The corn meal will act as little ball bearings to help
						move the pizza from the pizza peel into the oven.)
					</li>
					<li>Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.</li>
					<li>
						If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer, lightly shape it to
						the desired dimensions.
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your
						desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza
						with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Slide pizza into the oven:</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your
						hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough
						will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and
						add a bit more cornmeal. <br />
						Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the
						oven.
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Bake: </strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>
						Bake pizza in the 475¬∞F oven, one at a time, until the crust is
						browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you
						want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a
						little more cheese.
					</li>
					<br />
				</ul>
