		<h3>Description 👨‍🍳</h3>
		<p>
			The bistecca alla fiorentina or florentine steak is an Italian steak made
			of young steer or heifer that, combined with the specific preparation,
			makes it one of the most popular dishes of Tuscan cuisine. <br />
			It is a high cut including the bone, to be cooked on the embers or on the
			grill, with a degree of "blood" cooking.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients 🧂</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>fiorentina/T-bone/porterhouse (high cut)</strong></li>
			<li><strong>coarse salt</strong><em> to taste</em></li>
			<li><strong>black pepper</strong><em> to taste</em></li>
			<li><strong>olive oil</strong><em> to taste</em></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps 🍽️</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Preheat a grill pan</strong> on medium-high heat. Pat the steak
				dry, and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Tie the rosemary</strong> and sage bunches together with
				butcher’s twine to form an herb brush. Use the herbs to brush the steak
				with olive oil.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Place the steak on the grill</strong> pan, and char it well:
				cook about 12 minutes on the first side, flip, and cook about 9 minutes
				on the second side. Like we said earlier, this steak is traditionally
				served rare.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Remove the steak from the grill</strong> pan when it's done and
				allow it to stand for 5 minutes so that the juices are retained when the
				meat is cut. Carve off the fillet and strip steaks, and slice before
				serving. Serve hot, and enjoy!
			</li>
