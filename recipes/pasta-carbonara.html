				cheese, cured pork and black pepper.

			<h3 class="title">Ingredients ü•ö</h3>
			<div class="ingredients">
				<ul class="list">
					<li>
						400g <strong>pasta</strong> (spaghetti, mezze maniche, bucatini
					</li>
					<li>280g <strong>guanciale/pancetta</strong></li>
					<li>200g <strong>roman pecorino cheese</strong></li>
					<li>5 egg <strong>yolks</strong></li>
					<li><strong>black pepper</strong><em> to taste</em></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h3 class="title">Steps üçΩÔ∏è</h3>
			<ol class="steps">
				<li >
					<strong>Heat the pasta water:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for
							every 2 quarts of water.)
						</li>
						<br />
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Saut√© the pancetta or bacon and garlic:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter
							in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta
							and cook slowly until crispy.
						</li>

						<li>
							Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off
							the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.
						</li>
						<br />
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Beat the eggs and half of the cheese:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the
							cheese.
						</li>
						<br />
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Cook the pasta:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and
							cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.
						</li>
						<br />
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Toss the pasta with pancetta or bacon:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use
							tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be
							dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.
						</li>
						<li>
							Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the
							pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the
							eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.
						</li>
						<li>
							Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough
							so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in.
							(That's the tricky part.)
						</li>
						<br />
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Add the beaten egg mixture:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once
							more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to
							keep it from drying out.
						</li>
						<li>
							Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground
							black pepper. If you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped
							parsley.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
